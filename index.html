    <p>I understand the classic UNIX Magic poster by Gary Overacre was distributed at past USENIX conferences, and I’ve known of it for years but now in confinement, I’ve decided I want one to hang in my office.</p>
<p>The poster features a white bearded wizard with UNIX related objects around him, for example a spool of thread, a boot, a fork, pipes, and a bunch of containers labeled troff, awk, diff, uucp, make, null, and there’s even a C container and cracked B container. And some <a>oregano</a>:</p>

The oregano is reputedly referring to an incident in which one of the original folks involved with BSD was hassled for coming across the Canadian/U.S. border with a bag of what was assumed to be an illegal substance, and turned out to be oregano.

<p>How to get a poster which was drawn in 1986? There are lots of bad photos of the poster floating around, but certainly nothing good enough to turn into a poster of any size.</p>
<p>Via Twitter, <a>Jaume points to a 32MB PNG</a> (3675 x 5475) which I download and convert to TIFF. I then ask around a bit and find a shop willing to print that onto a material which looks exactly like what I want.</p>
<p>The material is called <a>Aluminium Dibond</a> which, and I quote, makes for a “matte, reflection-free print using a state-of-the-art, 7-color printing method. White and brighter parts of the image have a subtle sheen. With the aluminium Dibond backing, this print combines high picture quality and perfect durability”. Quite a mouthful, but the result, which I got in two days, is astonishing.</p>
<p>I love the material and how almost luxurious it looks and feels even though the colors are “matte” as described for this material. The result is not as vibrant or shiny as the image at the top of this page, but the advantage is no reflections when the light shines on it either.</p>
<p>I was a bit skeptical and shy of spending EUR 80 on the picture, but I can say without reservation, that I’m very happy with what <a>Whitewall</a> has made for me, and thanks to Jaume for the file!</p>
